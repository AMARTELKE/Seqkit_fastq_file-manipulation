## About the name

Originally, `fakit` (abbreviation of `FASTA kit`) was designed to handle FASTA
format. And the name was remained after adding ***seamless support for FASTA/Q fromat***.

## Introduction

FASTA and FASTQ are basic formats for storing nucleotide and protein sequences.
The manipulations of FASTA/Q file include converting, clipping, searching,
filtering, deduplication, splitting, shuffling, sampling and so on.
Existed tools only implemented parts of the functions,
and some of them are only available for specific operating systems.
Furthermore, the complicated installation process of dependencies packages and
running environment also make them less friendly to common users.

fakit is a cross-platform, efficient, and practical FASTA/Q manipulations tool
that is friendly for researchers to complete wide ranges of FASTA file processing.
The toolkit supports plain or gzip-compressed input and output
from either standard stream or files,
therefore, it could be easily used in command-line pipe.

## Technical details and guides for use

### FASTA/Q format parsing

fakit uses author's lightweight and high-performance bioinformatics packages
[bio](https://github.com/shenwei356/bio) for FASTA/Q parsingï¼Œ
which has [high performance](https://github.com/shenwei356/bio#compare-to-kseqh-klib)
close to the
famous C lib [kseq.h](https://github.com/attractivechaos/klib/blob/master/kseq.h).

### Sequence formats and types

fakit seamlessly support FASTA and FASTQ format.
All subcommands except for `faidx` can handle both formats.
And only when some commands (`subseq`, `split`, `sort` and `shuffle`)
which utilise FASTA index to improve perfrmance for large files in two pass mode
(by flag `--two-pass`), only FASTA format is supported.

Sequence format is automatically detected.

Sequence type (DNA/RNA/Protein) is automatically detected by leading subsequences
of the first sequences in file or STDIN. The length of the leading subsequences
is configurable by global flag `--alphabet-guess-seq-length` with default value
of 10000. If length of the sequences is less than that, whole sequences will
be checked.

### Sequence ID

By default, most softwares, including `fakit`, takes the first non-space
letters as sequence ID. For example,

|   FASTA head                                                  |     ID                                            |
|:--------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------|
| >123456 gene name                                             | 123456                                            |
| >longname                                                     | longname                                          |
| >gi&#124;110645304&#124;ref&#124;NC_002516.2&#124; Pseudomona | gi&#124;110645304&#124;ref&#124;NC_002516.2&#124; |

But for some sequences from NCBI,
e.g. `>gi|110645304|ref|NC_002516.2| Pseudomona`, the ID is `NC_002516.2`.
In this case, we could set sequence ID parsing regular expression by global flag
`--id-regexp "\|([^\|]+)\| "` or just use flag `--id-ncbi`. If you want
the `gi` number, then use `--id-regexp "^gi\|([^\|]+)\|"`.

### FASTA index

For some commands, including `subseq`, `split`, `sort` and `shuffle`,
when input files are (plain or gzipped) FASTA files,
FASTA index would be optional used for
rapid access of sequences and reducing memory occupation.

ATTENTION: the `.fakit.fai` file created by fakit is a little different from .fai file
created by samtools. fakit uses full sequence head instead of just ID as key.

### Parallelization of CPU intensive jobs

The validation of sequences bases and complement process of sequences
are parallelized for large sequences.

Parsing of line-based files, including BED/GFF file and ID list file are also parallelized.

The Parallelization is implemented by multiple goroutines in golang
 which are similar to but much
lighter weight than threads. The concurrency number is configurable with global
flag `-j` or `--threads` (default value: 1 for single-CPU PC, 2 for others).

### Memory occupation

Most of the subcommands do not read whole FASTA/Q records in to memory,
including `stat`, `fq2fa`, `fx2tab`, `tab2fx`, `grep`, `locate`, `replace`,
 `seq`, `sliding`, `subseq`.

Note that when using `subseq --gtf | --bed`, if the GTF/BED files are too
big, the memory usage will increase.
You could use `--chr` to specify chromesomes and `--feature` to limit features.

Some subcommands need to store sequences or heads in memory, but there are
strategy to reduce memory occupation, including `rmdup` and `common`.
When comparing with sequences, MD5 digest could be used to replace sequence by
flag `-m` (`--md5`).

Some subcommands could either read all records or read the files twice by flag
`-2` (`--two-pass`), including `sample`, `split`, `shuffle` and `sort`.
They use FASTA index for rapid acccess of sequences and reducing memory occupation.

### Reproducibility

Subcommands `sample` and `shuffle` use random function, random seed could be
given by flag `-s` (`--rand-seed`). This makes sure that sampling result could be
reproduced in different environments with same random seed.
